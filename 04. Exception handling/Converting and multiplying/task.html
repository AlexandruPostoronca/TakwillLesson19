  <p>Your task is to write a program that reads a sequence of strings and converts them to integer numbers, multiplying by 10. Some input strings may have an invalid format, for instance: "abc". The sequence length may be different. Its ending is indicated by “0”. Zero serves as a stop character and should not be included in the sequence.</p>
  <p>If a string can be converted to an integer number, output the number multiplied by 10. Otherwise, output the string <strong>"Invalid user input: X"</strong> where X is the input string. To better understand the scenario, see the examples below.</p>
  <p>To implement this logic, use the exception handling mechanism.</p>
  <p><strong>Input data format:</strong></p>
  <p>A sequence of integer numbers and other strings, each on a new line.</p>
  <p><strong>Output data format:</strong></p>
  <p>A sequence of integer numbers and warnings, each on a new line.</p>

   <p><strong> Sample Output 1: </strong></p>
